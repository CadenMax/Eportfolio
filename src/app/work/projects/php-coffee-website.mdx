## Overview

This project was developed as part of the 1621ICT Web Technologies course and required building a fully functional multi-page website using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The aim was to design and implement a complete website for a fictional client, focusing on layout, usability, responsiveness, and back-end integration using a provided SQLite database. The project demonstrated my ability to build both the front-end and back-end components without relying on frameworks.

## Key Features

- **Five-Page Website Structure**: The site included a home page and at least four additional pages, as required by the assignment brief.

- **Responsive Layout**: Designed with mobile and desktop breakpoints using custom CSS and media queries.

- **Dynamic PHP Integration**: Used PHP to connect to the provided SQLite database and display information from the Customers, Products, or Events tables.

- **Database Search / Entry Form**: Included a form that allowed users to either search database records or add new records using the functions supplied in `queryDb.php`.

- **Consistent Visual Design**: Implemented a unified theme and navigation across all pages, following best practices for layout and styling.

- **Use of Core HTML Elements**: Incorporated required elements including images, lists, and tables.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to build the site structure, page layouts, tables, and content.

- **CSS (No Frameworks)**: Styled all pages using custom CSS and media queries, as frameworks were not permitted.

- **PHP**: Used for server-side rendering, database operations, form handling, and dynamically displaying query results.

- **SQLite (Provided Database)**: Connected to a database file to retrieve or insert data using the pre-written PHP helper functions (`getCustomers()`, `getProducts()`, `getEvents()`, etc.).

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was working within strict constraints; no templates, no CSS frameworks, and a requirement to build all styling and layout manually. This helped strengthen my understanding of responsive design, media queries, and clean CSS architecture.

Another challenge was integrating the SQLite database using PHP. Understanding how to include the provided `queryDb.php` file, work with the existing functions, and properly loop through query results improved my confidence in back-end scripting. I also learned the importance of handling form submissions securely, even though the assignment's example functions did not include data sanitation.

The project also required designing a fictional client from scratch, which pushed me to think about user needs, site purpose, and content structure before writing any code.

## Outcome

The final website fulfilled all assignment requirements, including the five-page structure, PHP-powered database interaction, responsive design, and use of core HTML elements.  
This project strengthened my confidence in full-stack web development fundamentals and gave me hands-on experience building a deployed PHP site from scratch. It also reinforced important skills such as planning, design consistency, and working within technical limitations, skills that continue to influence how I approach web development projects today.
