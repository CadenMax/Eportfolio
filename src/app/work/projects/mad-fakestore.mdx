## Overview

This project was developed as part of a university assignment using React Native with Expo to build a cross-platform mobile application for Android and iOS. The brief required creating a functional “fake store” app with account management, product browsing, a shopping cart, and full navigation between screens. While the project followed strict feature requirements, I had full control over the design and user experience.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create an account, sign in, sign out, and update basic account details such as their name and password.
- **Global State Management**: User information and cart data are stored using React’s `useState` and `useContext`, allowing persistent state across the app while it is running.
- **Product Catalogue**: The app retrieves product details including images, descriptions, and prices from a pre-provided Fakestore API.
- **Category Filtering**: A dedicated categories screen allows users to filter items by type.
- **Item Detail Pages**: Each product has its own screen displaying all relevant information.
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Users can add items to a cart, review totals, adjust quantities, and proceed through a basic checkout flow.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native / Expo 50**: Used to build the application. Expo 50 was chosen over Expo 51 due to major breaking changes and limited course support for the newer version.
- **JavaScript**: Used for component logic, API data handling, and state management.
- **Fakestore API**: Provided all product data (titles, descriptions, images, costs).
- **React Navigation**: Implemented a structured navigation system using stack and tab navigators.
- **useState / useContext**: Managed user information, login state, and cart functionality without needing an external database.
- **Expo Components & Stylesheets**: Used for responsive mobile UI design and layout.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was deciding between Expo 50 and the newly released Expo 51. The newer version introduced breaking changes that deviated heavily from the course material, so I chose the stable option to ensure compatibility and reliability, an important lesson in evaluating technologies based on constraints rather than novelty.  

A second challenge was the scale of the application. This was the largest mobile project I had attempted, and it required learning React Native, Expo, and much of JavaScript simultaneously. Managing global state, API calls, authentication flows, and multi-screen navigation pushed me well beyond my previous experience. The process taught me how to break down complex problems, learn unfamiliar frameworks quickly, and structure code for maintainability.

## Outcome

The final application met all required features and received a grade of 84/100. Completing this project strengthened my confidence in mobile development and deepened my understanding of React Native, state management, and API integration. It demonstrated that I can deliver a functional and polished product while working within a defined brief and learning new technologies at speed.
