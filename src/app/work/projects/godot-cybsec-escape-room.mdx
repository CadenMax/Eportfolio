## Overview

This Escape Room game was developed for a real client as part of my final-year capstone project at Griffith University. Working in a small team, our goal was to create an interactive experience that could engage high school seniors and introduce them to key cyber security concepts during Open Day sessions.

## Key Features

- **Sustained Engagement**: The application needed to keep students engaged for approximately 45 minutes in a workshop-style environment.
- **Cyber Security Integration**: Each puzzle and scene had to incorporate core cyber security principles in a way that was intuitive and age-appropriate.
- **Local Deployment**: The client required the experience to run reliably on local machines, which we achieved by exporting the Godot game to HTML, embedding it in a custom webpage, and containerising it with Docker.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: for prototyping scenes and puzzle flows.
- **Godot Engine**: chosen for its lightweight performance and strength in 2D game development.
- **Git & GitHub**: for version control and collaborative workflow.
- **Aseprite**: for creating original pixel-art assets.
- **Docker**: to package the website into a portable deployment environment.
- **HTML/CSS**: to frame and present the exported game without unnecessary dependencies.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building the Cyber Security Escape Room challenged me to take a complex interactive concept and turn it into a cohesive Godot experience. I had to solve problems in puzzle design, scene logic, asset management, and game flow while keeping the project stable as more features were added. Working closely with the team taught me how to communicate changes clearly, document systems so others could build on them, and balance taking initiative with supporting the group. Overall, the project strengthened my technical problem-solving and collaborative development skills.

## Outcome

The final product met the client’s expectations and was delivered on time as a fully deployable experience. Throughout the project, I gained confidence in my ability to learn a new engine quickly, collaborate effectively, and contribute to a polished interactive application under real constraints. The process reinforced that I can work well in a team environment and adapt to unfamiliar technologies to produce results that align with client goals.
